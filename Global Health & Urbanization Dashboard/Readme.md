# Global Health & Urbanization Dashboard  
**Tableau · Data Analysis · Kaggle Dataset · Public Health Analytics**

This project explores the relationship between **urbanization**, **health outcomes**, and **healthcare access** using a synthetic global health dataset sourced from Kaggle. The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize how disease burden, mortality, and access to care vary as countries urbanize across different income levels.

The data was cleaned, and exported into Tableau to create a multi-view analytical dashboard.

## Dataset

**Source:** Kaggle  
**Type:** Synthetic global health dataset (no real patient data)  
**Format:** CSV  

The dataset includes:

- Country  
- Year  
- Region  
- Income group (low, middle, high)  
- Urbanization percentage  
- Disease burden index  
- Mortality metrics  
- Healthcare access indicators  

> Note: Because the dataset is synthetic, it is safe, anonymized, and designed for educational analysis.

### Data preparation tasks included:

- Handling missing values  
- Normalizing column formats  
- Creating calculated fields  
- Encoding income group & region values  
- Ensuring year-level consistency across countries

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes several interactive views:

### **1. Global Map**
- Urbanization rate by country  
- Regional differences  
- Tooltip health metrics  

### **2. Trend Analysis**
- Multi-year disease burden vs. urbanization trends  
- Income group comparisons  
- Regional filters  

### **3. Healthcare Access View**
- Scatterplots comparing:
  - Healthcare access  
  - Disease burden  
  - Urbanization levels  
- Trendlines for pattern interpretation  

### **4. Country Drill-Down**
- Country-specific trends  
- Urban growth vs. mortality  
- Income group context

## Key Insights

- Countries with **rapid urbanization but limited healthcare access** showed the **highest increases in disease burden**.  
- **Low-income countries** experienced the strongest negative health impact from urban growth.  
- **High-income countries** still show a link between urbanization and disease burden, but improved healthcare systems reduce the severity.  
- The data suggests that **investing in healthcare infrastructure** is the most effective way to offset the health impact of urban population increases.
